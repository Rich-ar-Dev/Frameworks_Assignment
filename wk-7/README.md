# 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib

## 🧠 Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to:

* Load and explore a dataset using **Pandas**
* Perform **basic data analysis** with descriptive statistics and groupings
* Create **visualizations** with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
* Summarize findings and insights from the data

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── dataset.csv         # (Your dataset file, e.g. Iris dataset or custom CSV)
├── analysis.ipynb      # Jupyter Notebook with code & outputs
├── script.py           # Python script version (optional)
├── README.md           # Project documentation
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run all cells to see data exploration, analysis, and visualizations.

### Option 2: Python Script

1. Run the script from terminal:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
2. The output will be printed in the console, and plots will open in separate windows.

## 📌 Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

* Loaded dataset (`pandas.read_csv` or Iris dataset from `sklearn`)
* Displayed first rows with `.head()`
* Checked data types and missing values
* Cleaned dataset by filling/dropping null values

### 🔹 Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

* Calculated summary statistics using `.describe()`
* Grouped categorical columns and calculated mean values
* Observed patterns and correlations

### 🔹 Task 3: Data Visualization

Created **4 types of plots** with titles, labels, and legends:

1. 📈 Line chart – trend over index or time
2. 📊 Bar chart – comparing averages across categories
3. 📉 Histogram – distribution of numerical column
4. ⚪ Scatter plot – relationship between two variables

### Scatter Plot Example

## 🔎 Findings & Observations

* Numerical values show clear variation across categories.
* Histograms reveal distributions that may suggest clustering.
* Scatter plots show correlations between selected features.
* Insights from grouping can guide further analysis or model building.
